# Fetch Club — long-form kinetic-typography film (16:9)

A ~5-minute, 40-beat looping film for dogs / off-leash club, rendered from its own
original bundle — only the words and the two pictures change. Built for LONG-FORM
video: every beat is a different type animation (~7.5s each), so a 2–5 minute
script never repeats a layout.

## Design system
- Paper `#f6ecd9`, ink `#2c231a`, accent `#e0762c`, second accent
  `#4d7a63`, tinted grounds `#e6ecdf` / `#f7dfc2`.
- **Baloo 2** display over **Nunito** body (bundled in the standalone).
- Brand mark top-left; per-scene garnish layer — rotating corner tag, italic
  footnote, vertical side label or spinning doodle — so no frame reads empty.
- Animated SVG world behind every scene: trotting dog with cycling legs, bouncing ball, paw prints.

## Shape vocabulary (40 authored beats)
Drawn from the kit's 60 scene renderers with no name repeating inside the film —
letter-level (Open, Rain, Spiral, Wave…), word-level (Problem, Marker, Magnet…),
line/block (Wilt, Curtain, Cards…), data (Counts, Ladder, Gauge, Plans…) and the
bookends (Kit chapter cards, Peek image card, QA, Join CTA). Slot keys include
kicker/title/sub/lines/steps/stats/items/words/pairs/rows/q&a/plans — text-first;
`image` appears twice (a mid-film setup card and the CTA logo).

## Casting notes
- 16:9 only (`portraitNative: false`); it is a LONG FORM gallery entry
  (`longForm: true`) and must not be rerouted to scene-kit past 75s
  (`longFormOk: true` — honoured per-pack by the pipeline).
- Copy law: `title` is the primary slot (kit convention) — the adapter maps it
  from the beat's own line.
- The engine caps the scene list at 50 entries and the serialized scenes string
  at 16KB; the adapter's `__kfplate__` sentinel keeps the branded fill plate out
  of that budget.
